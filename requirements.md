Biography
THE GRIM STARTED IN 1982 PLAYING PARTIES IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. THEIR MUSIC APPEARED ON NUMEROUS COMPILATION RECORDS RELEASED BY MYSTIC RECORDS. IN 1984 MYSTIC RELEASED THEIR SELF TITLED RECORD KNOWN AS THE "ORANGE ALBUM". YOU MAY HAVE SEEN IT AS A BACKDROP IN THE MOVIE "PRETTY IN PINK". THE GRIM TOURED THE COUNTRY WITH NOFX, SCARED STRAIGHT. THEY PLAYED WITH BANDS LIKE SOCIAL DISTORTION, BAD RELIGION, NOFX, MINUTEMEN, PENNYWISE, THE VANDALS, DESCENDANTS, FACE TO FACE, RKL, NO USE FOR A NAME, ILL REPUTE, CIRCLE JERKS, AND MANY MORE! THE SONG, "SAIPAN DEATH MARCH" WAS ONE OF THE MOST REQUESTED SONGS ON THE RODNEY ON THE ROQ SHOW IN 1984. IN 1986 MYSTIC RECORDS RELEASED A SUPER SEVEN INCH RECORD FEATURING 4 SONGS RECORDED IN A TELEVISION STUDIO, ENTITLED "LIVE TO DIE". IN 1987 THE GRIM RECORDED AN ALBUM FOR MYSTIC THAT WAS EVENTUALLY RELEASED ON ALCHEMY RECORDS CALLED FACE OF BETRAYAL. IN 1988 MYSTIC RELEASED THE 7" LIVE AT FENDERS.
THE BAND ENDED IN THE MID 90'S WHEN TIM STARTED WORKING FOR NOFX. THE BAND DID A COUPLE OF REUNION SHOWS IN EARLY 2001 WITH THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS, BUT SINCE JORDAN WAS IN STRUNG OUT THE REUNION WAS SHORT LIVED.
FAST FORWARD TO 2010 THE BAND REFORMED WITH 3 NEW MEMBERS. TIM WAS ALWAYS TALKING WITH WITH EX JUGHEAD'S REVENGE BASSIST BRIAN PREISS ABOUT STARTING UP A NEW BAND, BUT BRIAN CONVINCED HIM TO REFORM THE GRIM. WHEN HE DECIDED TO CALL BOB, HE AGREED TO DO THE GRIM ONE MORE TIME.
JEFF YEARSLEY WAS ASKED TO PLAY 2ND GUITAR. JEFF WAS A FELLOW BAND MATE AND FRIEND OF BRIAN'S FROM THE EARLY PUNK ROCK DAYS. THE BAND PLAYED THEIR FIRST SHOW WITH THE NEW LINE UP OPENING UP FOR THE ADOLESCENTS IN THE SUMMER OF 2010. 2016 SAW THE ADDITION OF ONE OF SIMI VALLEY'S FINEST DRUMMERS, MICAH ROSSELLINI. THE BAND WAS NOW COMPLETE AND IN 2017 RELEASED A NEW 7" ON FELONY RECORDS. IN 2018, THE BAND IS SET TO RELEASE THEIR FIRST FULL LENTH VINYL IN 30 YEARS WITH NEW WORLD ORDER THROUGH SOUND SPEED RECORDS.

Hi Beth,

Here are some more photos for your consideration:

First two live photos are of Bob Oedy (photos by Evil Tracy)
Third and fourth live photos are of Tim McDuffee (photos by Evil Tracy)
fifth and sixth live photos are the band (photos by Jason Cook)
Sixth is the artwork for our upcoming album "Nuclear World Order" on Sound Speed Records
Seventh is Sound Speed Records logo

Some of the pages I would like the site to have
About - a little history of The Grim
Merch - We could sell some t-shirts, hats, patches, records, my books (like The Punk Rock Las Vegas Survival Guide)
Links - So we can get more followers and help out friend's bands
Press - We do a lot of interviews, our music was just in a horror film called "The Ranger"
Contact - So they can book us and stuff

Maybe a page with a collage (thumbnails) of old and new flyers

Let me know your thoughts...
